There’s an idea that’s been gaining ground in the tech community lately: Everyone<br>
should learn to code. But here’s the problem with that idea: Coding is not the new literacy.

If you regularly pay attention to the cultural shenanigans of Silicon Valley, you’ve<br>
no doubt heard of the “Learn to Code” movement. Politicians, nonprofit organizations<br>
like Code.org and even former Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City have evangelized<br>
what they view as a necessary skill for tomorrow’s workforce.

There may be some truth to that, especially since the United States’ need for engineers<br>
shows no sign of slowing down.

But the picture is more complicated.

We live in an ultra-competitive world, with people turning to all sorts of methods to<br>
make ends meet. Selling coding as a ticket to economic salvation for the masses is dishonest.

Take coding bootcamps. Since the mainstream learned of the success of Silicon Valley<br>
software engineers, everyone wants to own a startup or become an engineer.<br>
HBO’s Silicon Valley paints a picture of late twenty-somethings spending their<br>
nights coding and smoking weed, all whilst making millions of dollars.<br>
The American public is amazed by figures like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg,<br>
who make millions seemingly overnight. Coding fever has even reached the steps of<br>
the White House, with President Obama pushing for legislation to include computer<br>
science in every public-school curriculum.

Inexplicably, it is not just bootcamps and politicians encouraging people to learn to code.

Individuals are actively encouraged to do so from all sides of society, from Hollywood<br>
to current tech luminaries. Despite this growing buzz, I view bootcamps with intense<br>
skepticism. While our culture tends to make Silicon Valley sexy, and glossy bootcamp<br>
brochures promise well-paying jobs, the truth is that many of these institutions are<br>
not accredited, do not post job statistics and do a poor job of ensuring their students’<br>
post-bootcamp success. While many coding bootcamps are legitimate and care for their pupils,<br>
an even greater number are run by modern snake-oil salespeople tapping into the average<br>
American’s desperation.
