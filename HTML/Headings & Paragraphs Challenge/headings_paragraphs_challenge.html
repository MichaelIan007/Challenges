          All that is told here happened some time before Mowgli was turned out of the<br>
          Seeonee Wolf Pack, or revenged himself on Shere Khan the tiger. It was in the<br>
          days when Baloo was teaching him the Law of the Jungle. The big, serious,<br>
          old brown bear was delighted to have so quick a pupil, for the young wolves<br>
          will only learn as much of the Law of the Jungle as applies to their own pack<br>
          and tribe, and run away as soon as they can repeat the Hunting Verse —‘Feet<br>
          that make no noise; eyes that can see in the dark; ears that can hear the<br>
          winds in their lairs, and sharp white teeth, all these things are the marks<br>
          of our brothers except Tabaqui the Jackal and the Hyaena whom we hate.’<br>

          <strong>
          But Mowgli, as a man-cub, had to learn a great deal more than this. Sometimes<br>
          Bagheera the Black Panther would come lounging through the jungle to see how<br>
          his pet was getting on, and would purr with his head against a tree while<br>
          Mowgli recited the day’s lesson to Baloo. The boy could climb almost as well<br>
          as he could swim, and swim almost as well as he could run.

          <strong>
          So Baloo, the Teacher of the Law, taught him the Wood and Water Laws: how to<br>
          tell a rotten branch from a sound one; how to speak politely to the wild bees<br>
          when he came upon a hive of them fifty feet above ground; what to say to Mang<br>
          the Bat when he disturbed him in the branches at midday; and how to warn the<br>
          water-snakes in the pools before he splashed down among them.

          <strong>
          None of the Jungle People like being disturbed, and all are very ready to fly<br>
          at an intruder. Then, too, Mowgli was taught the Strangers’ Hunting Call, which<br>
          must be repeated aloud till it is answered, whenever one of the Jungle-People<br>
          hunts outside his own grounds. It means, translated, ‘Give me leave to hunt<br>
          here because I am hungry.’ And the answer is,‘Hunt then for food, but not for<br>
          pleasure.’

          <strong>
          All this will show you how much Mowgli had to learn by heart, and he grew very<br>
          tired of saying the same thing over a hundred times. But, as Baloo said to<br>
          Bagheera, one day when Mowgli had been cuffed and run off in a temper, ‘A man’s<br>
          cub is a man’s cub, and he must learn all the Law of the Jungle.’ ‘But think<br>
          how small he is,’ said the Black Panther, who would have spoiled Mowgli if he<br>
          had had his own way. ‘How can his little head carry all thy long talk?’<br>
          ‘Is there anything in the jungle too little to be killed? No. That is why I<br>
          teach him these things, and that is why I hit him, very softly, when he forgets.’<br>
          ‘Softly! What dost thou know of softness, old Ironfeet?’ Bagheera grunted.<br>
          ‘His face is all bruised today by thy— softness. Ugh.’
          </strong>
        </p>
          <br><br/>
          <h2 align="center">‘Better he should</h2>
          <p align="center">
          be bruised from head to foot by me who love him than that he<br>
          should come to harm through ignorance,’ Baloo answered very earnestly. ‘I am now<br>
          teaching him the Master Words of the Jungle that shall protect him with the birds<br>
          and the Snake People, and all that hunt on four feet, except his own pack. He can<br>
          now claim protection, if he will only remember the words, from all in the jungle.<br>
          Is not that worth a little beating?’
        </p>
          <br><br/>
          <h3 align="center">‘Well, look to</h3>
        <p align="center">
          it then that thou dost not kill the mancub. He is no tree trunk to sharpen thy blunt<br>
          claws upon. But what are those Master Words? I am more likely to give help than to<br>
          ask it’ —Bagheera stretched out one paw and admired the steel-blue, ripping-chisel<br>
          talons at the end of it—‘still I should like to know.’
