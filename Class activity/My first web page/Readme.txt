BASIC
To start a document rename it saying "index.html".
On the first line enter "html" and press "enter".
What it will display now is the current coding language in order to start documenting your text.

Remember; commenting is crucial, Indentation is essential for code quality.
Comment just under the "body" eg. Writing a paragraph then push "cntrl + /" to add the comment to the section.

Codes:
<H1></h1> Header 1 (allow 1 to 6 Headers)
<p></p>
<ins></ins>
<strong></strong>
<br>
<em></em>

When inserting Picture and it is not the size that you would like, make changes to the code as such "<img src="img/Idiocracy.jpg">"
											width="300px" height="250pxc"
