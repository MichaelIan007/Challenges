Hello and welcome viewer,

Inside this html webpage is a responsive grid.

When you open it, you should see 4 main blocks and in the 2nd one there should be 3 smaller ones.

What should happen it that when you make the webpage smaller than 500pixels, all the Main boxes should fall under one another and the smaller ones inside the second box as well.
